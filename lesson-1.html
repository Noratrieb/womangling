            After getting an understanding of how this guide works and learning
            about the not-mangling of C identifiers, we are ready to dive into
            C++.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every C++ mangled symbol is prefixed with the string
            <code>_Z</code>. This signifies that this is a mangled C++ symbol.
            <code>_Z</code> starts with an underscore followed by an uppercase
            letter. All symbols of that structures are reserved by the C
            standard and cannot be used by programs. This ensures that there are
            no name collisions with normal C functions and mangled C++
            functions.
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, the name of the entity is stored. For now, we will only
            look at functions. For functions, the function type is appended to
            the name to get the full symbol.
          </p>
          <pre class="code">
void f() {}
          </pre>
          <p>
            This empty function will be mangled to <code>_Z1fv</code>. The
            <code>1f</code> signifies the name (we will look at this in more
            detail later in this lesson) and the <code>v</code> signifies the
            function type.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will see the <code>v</code> function type a lot in the rest of
            this guide. It stands for a function that takes no arguments and
            returns <code>void</code>.

            For names, there are two cases to consider for now. Either the name
            is in the global scope, or it is in a namespace.
          </p>
          <p>For global names, we just prefix the name with its length.</p>
          <pre class="code">
void hello_world() {}
          </pre>
          <p>
            This will therefore get mangled as <code>_Z11hello_worldv</code>.
            The length of <code>hello_world</code> is 11, so we concatenate
            <code>11</code> and <code>hello_world</code>. This entire thing is
            then appended to the previously mentioned prefix <code>_Z</code> and
            then we add the type, which is just <code>v</code> here, at the end.

            Functions that are declared in a namespace get a bit more
            complicated. They are referred to as <i>nested names</i>, because
            they are <i>nested</i> in a namespace. They can also be nested in
            multiple namespaces, the encoding is the same.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nested names start with an <code>N</code> and end with an
            <code>E</code>. Between those two letters, the hierarchy of the
            namespace is represented by putting on namespace name after another,
            with the function name last. Every name has the leading length and
            then the name itself, just like with global names.
          </p>
          <pre class="code">
namespace outer {
  void inner() {}
}
          </pre>
          <p>
            That means that this function will be mangled as
            <code>_ZN5outer5innerEv</code>. We can decode this into the
            following structure
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>_Z</code>: Prefix</li>
            <li><code>N</code>: Start of nested name</li>
            <li>
              <code>5outer</code>: Outer namespace, name prefixed by length
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>5inner</code>: Inner function, name prefixed by length
            </li>
            <li><code>E</code>: End of nested name</li>
            <li><code>v</code>: Function type</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Nested namespaces follow the same structure.</p>
          <pre class="code">
namespace a {
  namespace b {
    namespace c {
      void inner() {}
    }
  }
}
          </pre>
          <p>
            This function will mangle as <code>_ZN1a1b1c5innerEv</code>. We get
            all the concatinated names as <code>1a1b1c5inner</code>, with the
            previously mentioned characters around them.

            Good job! You have successfully answered all the question and now
            know the basic makeup of an Itanium-mangled C++ symbol.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the next lesson, we will use this knowledge to look at basic
            function types beyond <code>v</code>. Mangling function types is
            important for function overloading, but I don't want to overload you
            with information, so feel free to take a break and let the previous
            knowledge sink in.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to try out more code and look at its mangling, I
            recommend using Compiler Explorer on
            <a href="https://godbolt.org">godbolt.org</a>. Under "Output", you
            can uncheck the box to demangle identifiers to see the mangled
            identifiers for any C++ code you enter on the left.
