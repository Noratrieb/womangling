            All symbols that we have looked at so far have ended with a
            <code>v</code>. I have previously explained that the
            <code>v</code> stands for a function type with no arguments.
          </p>
          <p>
            C++ has function overloading, which means that a function with the
            same name can be declared multiple times with different argument
            types, and the one with matching argument types will be called. If
            we just mangled the function name as shown previously, this wouldn't
            work, because we'd get multiple symbols with the same name, which is
            exactly what mangling is designed to avoid. Therefore, any C++
            mangling scheme must encode the function argument types in the
            symbol name.
          </p>
          <pre class="code">
void a(int x);
void a(char *y);
int main() {
  a(0); // This will call the first a
}
          </pre>
          <p>
            The function type is encoded after the name. It contains all the
            arguments for the function. In some cases it will also contain the
            return type first, but not for the functions we are looking at right
            now.
          </p>
          <pre class="code">
void a(int x, int y, long z) {}
          </pre>
          <p>
            This function will be mangled as <code>_Z1aiil</code>. We already
            know what <code>_Z1a</code> means, but the <code>iil</code> is new.
            It represents the three arguments, an <code>int</code>, another
            <code>int</code>, and then a <code>long</code>. The primitives are
            just a single character, more complex types have more characters.
          </p>
          <p>
            A function taking zero arguments is interpreted as a function taking
            <code>(void)</code>, which is encoded as <code>v</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>int</code> is <code>i</code>, <code>long</code> is
            <code>l</code>. <code>float</code> is <code>f</code>,
            <code>double</code> is <code>d</code>. These types are very easy to
            remember, many others less so. Other easy to remember frequently
            used types are pointers (<code>T*</code>) which are encoded as
            <code>P</code> followed by the pointed to type and references
            (<code>T&</code>) which encoded as <code>R</code> followed by the
            referenced type.
          </p>
          <pre class="code">
void a(int x, int *y, double &z) {}
          </pre>
          <p>
            This function is mangled as <code>_Z1aiPiRd</code>. It's an
            <code>int</code> (<code>i</code>), a
            <code>int*</code> (<code>Pi</code>), and a
            <code>double&</code> (<code>Rd</code>).

            We can combine this with our previous knowledge of nested names to

          <p>Let's look at a few more common types.</p>
          <p>
            <code>char</code> is <code>c</code>. <code>unsigned int</code> is
            <code>j</code> (like <code>i</code> but one higher).
            <code>unsigned long</code> is <code>m</code>, following the same
            pattern. <code>long long</code> (64-bit) is <code>x</code> (you can
            think of it being the native integer, integer x on modern machines)-
            <code>unsigned long long</code> is <code>y</code>, again being one
            higher. <code>short</code> is <code>s</code>, with its unsigned
            variant being, you may have guessed it, <code>t</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the future there might be a part of the website where you can
            memorize these encodings more easily.

            Good job! You have now learnt about the mangling of basic types. In
            the next lesson, we will use there types as template arguments.
